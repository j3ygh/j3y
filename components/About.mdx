# Hello world

I'm Jimmy. I love programming. I like to create things and programming gives me the chance to do so.

I have five years of programming experience, mostly in Python.

# Education

[National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) (2011/09 ~ 2016/06)

# Experience

[Chief Telecom](https://www.chief.com.tw/) (2017/06 ~ 2021/06)

I work for their cloud service department. I maintain and develop products and services about [Chief Cloud](https://www.chief.com.tw/cloud/).

# Skills

Here are my skills and the techniques I use:

## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is my primary programming language. I am familiar with Python's language features and many of its standard libraries such as [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html), and [shlex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html), etc. I care about code quality, following [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and many other code style conventions. I follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). I keep my code clean, modular and reusable.

## Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python's web framework I've spent most of my time with. I've been doing web development with Django for over 5 years. I can build modern, well-tested web application with it.

## Django REST Framwork

Django is pretty good, but when you combine it with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), it gets even better. Modern web applications often require REST APIs, and this is where the Django REST Framework comes in.

## SQL

Django has a great model/ORM system, which makes it possible to creating a web application without writing SQL. But sometimes SQL knowledge is important, too. It is true especially when it comes to a extremely complicated queriy or some performance issue.

## React.js / Next.js

Now, when it comes to frontend things, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is my favorite. Its philosophy is so graceful, making you enjoy coding and building things with it. This website is built with React.js, too.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) gives me a lot of things out of the box. It lets me not worry about the [SSG/SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) things, which is pretty annoying to implement on our own.

## Vue.js

In addition to React.js, I also use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). I personally like React.js more, but they are both very powerful andd reliable frameworks.

## Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is another tool that I love and use a lot. It is similar to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), but it is much more flexible and easy to customize, which prevents you from building a lot of similar web.

## HTML / CSS / JavaScript

In addition to developing with frontend frameworks, I also know about HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I think, after all, frameworks are based on these three elements, so it is important to have a solid understanding of them.

## GitHub Actions

I use [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to handle CI/CD things. I believe that deployment is just as important as development. If a feature can't be delivered to the users, the resources spent on development will be wasted.

## Docker

I mostly run my services in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which frees me from a lot of environment and compatibility concerns. Docker greatly increases the portability and flexibility of the services.

## GCP

[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) is where most of my services are hosted. This website is such a example. I usually use their compute engines with Docker.

# Portfolios

Here are some screenshots of them:

## CTDB

<div className="my-8">

</div>

<div className="my-8">
  <Image src={ctdbLog} alt="ctdbLog" className="rounded-sm" />
</div>

CTDB is mainly built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), containing several useful applications, such as Diary, Reminder, Telecom, News, Archive, etc. It also has its own log system. It is mainly used by engineers in the technical department of the company.

### Features:

i18n / Log system

### Tech stack:

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) / [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) / [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

## FortiAdmin

</div>

<div className="my-8">
  <Image src={fortiadminLogin} alt="fortiadminLogin" className="rounded-sm" />
</div>

FortiAdmin is mainly built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [shlex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html), [Forti](https://www.fortinet.com/) REST API which is a multi-tenant portal for Fortigate/Fortios. With FortiAdmin, It is possible to set their own config without interfere with each other for different users.

### Features:

Multi-tenant / [Forti](https://www.fortinet.com/) REST API

### Tech stack:

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) / [shlex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html) / [Forti](https://www.fortinet.com/) REST API
