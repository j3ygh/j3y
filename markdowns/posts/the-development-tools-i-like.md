# The development tools I like

Today, there are many tools available to help smooth out the development process.

## [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I used It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages.

## [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Aside from the time it takes to get familiar with the instructions, I don't see what's wrong with [Git](https://git-scm.com/). However, I haven't spent much time studying version control software other than it. Maybe I should, so I can measure their pros and cons.

## [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

I used to use [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which doesn't have many features but is easy to use. I switched to [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) a few days ago. I don't know much about these [Git](https://git-scm.com/) GUI, but [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) seems great now. Opening it up, there are so many features, but you just need to follow your intuition, you can correctly get what you want. I especially like the conflict editor. I think I'll use it for a while and then evaluate whether to continue.

## [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

Note that this is not the Powershell built in your Windows OS. It is the new core of it, which is better. When it comes to console/terminal on windows, CMD is the first classic one, which we all know about, but I don't like because it is ugly and hard to use, especially when you copy and paste something quickly or type some weird characters, there are always some trouble with it. Recently, I found that [Windows terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is also a good choice, I think I'll switch to it soon.

## [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

It is always annoying to handle the compatibility along different environments. With [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), I don't need to be worried about those things that much, but [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) itself could spend your time too, especially when the first time you trying to convert all your locally-running codes into those Docker image things.

## [WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0eqZujVfYU)

WSL make it possible to run whatever you want to on Linux. I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0eqZujVfYU) and decide to give it a try later. I [WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0eqZujVfYU) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) are can sometimes be substituted for each other, but in some cases one is much better than the other, so I'll try to learn both.

## [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_zh-tw)

The package manager of MacOS. With Linux, you usually have some built-in package manager already, but with MacOS, you need to use this.

## [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

Same as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_zh-tw), it is the the package manager of Windiws.
