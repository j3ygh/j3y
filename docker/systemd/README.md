# Systemd

This directory is about `systemd`, which is used to run our docker services a Linux server with `systemd`.

With `systemd`, we can control our services with commands like `systemctl enable my-service` and `systemctl status my-service`.

The files in `systemd` (except this `READEME.md` file) should be placed in `/etc/systemd`.
