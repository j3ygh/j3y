title: Ubuntu DB ODBC issues
---

### ODBC could be annoying, these article list out some ODBC issues I got.

1. Using Ubuntu 20.04 to connect to a MSSQL:

    ```bash
    sudo su
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/19.10/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list
    exit
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y msodbcsql17
    sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y mssql-tools
    sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev
    ```

2. For Windows 10:

```bash

```

Note:

ODBC issue is so annoying so I don't want to test all of these situations well. Please use these commands carefully and do the some Google research before using them. Or just backup your data in case there are some unexpected error.
