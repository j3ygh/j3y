# About me

# Hello world

I'm Jimmy. I love programming. I like to create things and programming gives me the chance to do so.

I have five years of programming experience, mostly in Python.

# Education

## [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) (2011/09 ~ 2016/06)

# Experience

## [Chief Telecom](https://www.chief.com.tw/) (2017/06 ~ 2021/06)

I work for their cloud service department. I maintain and develop products and services about [Chief Cloud](https://www.chief.com.tw/cloud/).

# Skills

Here are my skills and the techniques I use:

## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is my primary programming language. I am familiar with Python's language features and many of its standard libraries such as [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html), and [shlex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html), etc. I care about code quality, following [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and many other code style conventions. I follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). I keep my code clean, modular and reusable.

## Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python's web framework I've spent most of my time with. I've been doing web development with Django for over 5 years. I can build modern, well-tested web application with it.

## Django REST Framwork

Django is pretty good, but when you combine it with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), it gets even better. Modern web applications often require REST APIs, and this is where the Django REST Framework comes in.

## SQL

Django has a great model/ORM system, which makes it possible to creating a web application without writing SQL. But sometimes SQL knowledge is important, too. It is true especially when it comes to a extremely complicated queriy or some performance issue.

## React.js / Next.js

Now, when it comes to frontend things, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is my favorite. Its philosophy is so graceful, making you enjoy coding and building things with it. This website is built with React.js, too.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) gives me a lot of things out of the box. It lets me not worry about the [SSG/SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) things, which is pretty annoying to implement on our own.

## Vue.js

In addition to React.js, I also use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). I personally like React.js more, but they are both very powerful andd reliable frameworks.

## Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is another tool that I love and use a lot. It is similar to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), but it is much more flexible and easy to customize, which prevents you from building a lot of similar web.

## HTML / CSS / JavaScript

In addition to developing with frontend frameworks, I also know about HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I think, after all, frameworks are based on these three elements, so it is important to have a solid understanding of them.

## GitHub Actions

I use [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to handle CI/CD things. I believe that deployment is just as important as development. If a feature can't be delivered to the users, the resources spent on development will be wasted.

## Docker

I mostly run my services in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which frees me from a lot of environment and compatibility concerns. Docker greatly increases the portability and flexibility of the services.

## GCP

[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) is where most of my services are hosted. This website is such a example. I usually use their compute engines with Docker.

# Portfolios

Here are some screenshots of them:

## CTDB
